Hello and welcome to TextHunter

This is the first 'official' release (in the loosest possible sense). Simply unzip and run 

texthunter.bat. Note, the program has primarily been developed 

to run on Windows 7+.Java 7+ is required. Apologies for the 

lack of instructions at this stage. A full manual and 

documentation will follow soon (Currently battling other PhD 

priorities!). Source Code available on GitHub
